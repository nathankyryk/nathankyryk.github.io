title: Google Finance Stock Market Data Analysis
---
This is an end-to-end data-driven project utilizing Google Sheets, SQL, and Power BI, where I analyzed the stock performance of companies and their industries, as well as the cities where the headquarters are located for 160 companies across eight distinct industries.
## Data Collection (2023-2025)
For this project, I used the 'GOOGLEFINANCE' function in Google Sheets to extract stock data from 160 different companies across eight distinct industries. The data spans two CSV files that are linked by the 'ticker' and 'company_name' attributes.
* 'CompanyInfo.csv' - Contains company information for one hundred and sixty companies across eight distinct industries, with twenty companies per industry. The city where each company is headquartered is also noted.
* 'StockData.csv' - Contains the collected start price, end price, price change, and percent change for each company's stocks, as well as their tickers and company names.
