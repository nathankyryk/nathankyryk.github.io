title: NFL Data Bowl 2026
---

I will be working on an NFL Big Data Bowl submission with one partner. This project will test several models to minimize the RMSE of a prediction model working with big data to predict player movement after the ball is thrown. I will incorporate libraries such as TensorFlow, Keras, and Scikit-learn for deep learning/machine learning.
