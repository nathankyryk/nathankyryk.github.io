title: Image to PDF Converter
---

I wanted to work on a project where I could create an application and learn how to work with GUIs, while also creating something that I can use regularly. I decided to make an image-to-PDF application using PIL for conversion and Tkinter for the GUI. The GUI contains buttons for adding images, removing selected images, and converting the added images to PDF format, in the order they were added.
